**Menu UX**: Desktop (collapsed icon-only, expands on hover/click) | Mobile (hamburger full-screen slide) | Auto-collapse | 300ms spring animations | Backdrop blur | Shadow gradients | Active states

## Golden Principle
"Always code as if someone else—who knows where you live—is going to maintain your code."

Enforce consistently. Clear feedback on violations. Help developers comply.

## 1. Context Maanagement (MANDATORY)

### 1.1 Complete Project Context
**Rule:** BEFORE ANY CODE OPERATION: 
- VERIFY complete project context loaded (README.md, requirements.txt/package.json, architecture docs)
- REJECT requests if context incomplete or stale
- VALIDATE scope boundaries - only work within authorized project directories
- REFRESH context automatically when files modified

### 1.2 Context Requirements
**Rule:** Context MUST include: 
- README.md with clear project objectives
- Dependencies file (requirements.txt, package.json, pyproject.toml)
- Architecture documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, design docs)
- Environment setup (.env.example)

### 1.3 Scope Boundaries
**Rule:** 
- ALLOW: ./src/**, ./lib/**, ./tests/**, ./docs/**, ./scripts/**
- FORBID: ./node_modules/**, ./.env, ./secrets/**, ./.git/**

## 2. Prompt Structure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 2.1 Structured Requests
**Rule:** ACCEPT ONLY STRUCTURED REQUESTS WITH: 
- CONTEXT: Brief description of what you're working on
- GOAL: What you want to achieve
- CONSTRAINTS: Limitations, requirements, preferences
- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Format, files, specific deliverables

### 2.2 Rejection Criteria
**Rule:** REJECT requests that are: 
- Vague ("make this better", "fix this")
- Missing context or constraints
- Unclear about expectations
- Lacking sufficient specificity

**Example Acceptable Request:**
```
CONTEXT: Building REST API for task management using FastAPI and PostgreSQL
GOAL: Implement user authentication with JWT tokens
CONSTRAINTS: OAuth 2.0 standards, bcrypt passwords, refresh token mechanism
EXPECTED OUTPUT: Complete auth module with endpoints, models, middleware, tests
```

## 3. UI/UX Heuristic Enforcement

### 3.1 Tech Stack
**Framework Compliance:** Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript ONLY. Validate package.json dependencies and tsconfig.json configuration. Reject non-compliant framework requests with migration guidance.

```markdown
Vercel-Native: ALL backend operations MUST use Vercel and Next.js native services. Verify proper SDK imports (@vercel/postgres, @vercel/blob, @vercel/kv) and service configurations. Block alternative backend suggestions without explicit architectural justification.

Required Stack:
- Auth: Next.js + Auth.js (NextAuth.js v5+)
- Database: Vercel Postgres (@vercel/postgres) or Vercel KV (@vercel/kv)
- Storage: Vercel Blob Storage (@vercel/blob)
- Config: Edge Config (@vercel/edge-config)
- Backend: Next.js API Routes, Server Actions, Edge Functions

Verification Checklist:
✓ Confirm @vercel/* package imports
✓ Validate environment variables (POSTGRES_URL, KV_URL, BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN)
✓ Ensure Next.js App Router patterns (app/ directory, Server Components)
✓ Check proper use of 'use server' directives for Server Actions
✓ Reject external services (Firebase, Supabase, AWS Amplify) unless justified

Block non-Vercel backends unless you provide:
- Technical limitation of Vercel services
- Cost/scale justification with specific metrics
- Migration constraint with timeline
```
